# Laptop-Price-Prediction-Application-
Created a robust machine learning model to accurately predict laptop prices based on various features such as brand, specifications, and market trends, utilizing regression algorithms and feature engineering. 
Collected and pre-processed extensive datasets, ensuring data quality and consistency by handling missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Successfully developed the Graphic User Interface, integrating backend services with a responsive front-end using interface to allow seamless user interactions and real-time price predictions.
Continuously monitored and optimized the application's performance, cross-validation, and model training to achieve high accuracy of 87%.
